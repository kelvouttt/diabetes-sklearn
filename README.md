# sklearn toy dataset 'load_diabetes()'

This repo is part of my training in machine learning using regression module from scikit-learn. My reference is from the scikit website, I am just trying to simplify it by using the train_test_split function to split the data instead of explicitly choosing the index from the example. 

The code is also available on Google Colab.
